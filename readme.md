🪝 use-debounce-fn

A lightweight, zero-dependency React hook for debouncing any function — with full TypeScript support and cancel/flush control.

Features

Debounce any function — delays execution until the user stops triggering it

Optional immediate execution on the first call

Cancel a pending execution

Flush immediately if needed

Fully compatible with Vite

Tiny and fast — zero external dependencies

Fully unit tested

Built with and fully typed in TypeScript

Dual Export Support

Installation
npm install use-debounce-fn

Usage
import useDebounceFn from 'use-debounce-fn';
import { useState } from 'react';

function SearchInput() {  
 const [query, setQuery] = useState('');

const debouncedSearch = useDebounceFn((q: string) => {  
 console.log('Searching for', q);  
 // Call API or filter results here  
 }, 500); // 500ms debounce delay

const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {  
 const value = e.target.value;  
 setQuery(value);  
 debouncedSearch(value);  
 };

return <input value={query} onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Search..." />;  
}

API
const debouncedFn = useDebounceFn(
fn: Function,
delay: number,
options?: { immediate?: boolean }
);

fn: Function you want to debounce

delay: Delay in milliseconds

options.immediate: If true, runs on the first call, then debounces after

Methods

debouncedFn.cancel() → Cancels any pending execution

debouncedFn.flush() → Immediately executes the pending function (if any)

How It Works

Internally, it uses setTimeout and clearTimeout to delay running your function until a certain time has passed since the last call.

Why This Matters

I built use-debounce-fn to solve a common UI performance issue in React: when functions like API calls or expensive state updates run too frequently during user input.
This hook keeps apps fast and efficient — written in modern TypeScript, showcasing reusable hooks, debouncing logic, and clean developer experience.
